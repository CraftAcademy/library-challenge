As a Customer

I want to be able to see a list of books that are available with the title and the author.
I would like to know the date of when I need to return the book.

As a Library

We would like to store our books by title and author in a application and easily be able to see if the book is available or not.
We would like that customers could checkout their books.
The books would have a return date of one month.
