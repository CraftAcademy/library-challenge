# Library Challenge
## Week 1 Ruby challenge

### Problem Statement
-------
A newly built library does not have a system to track their books. 
We will build a system that features a list which stores all the books, along with their titles and authors.
The librarian can also check the availability of each book.
Visitors can rent books and will be able to see the required return date. When a book is rented, the return date will be listed in the system.

### User stories
