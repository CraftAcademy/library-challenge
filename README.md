## Library Challenge

### Requirements were

I am supposed to imagine that I am approached by library and they have these requirements:
“We need an app where both the visitors and the library can see if a list of books is available, it would be nice to see both the title and the author of the book. The library needs to store these books in a file where we can easily check if a book is available or not. The library also needs the visitors to check out books after finding the title they want. Depending on the time of the checkout the library needs the books to be returned within a month and obviously, it would be nice for the visitor to know which date to return the book.”
