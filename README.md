## Library Challenge
### the code

This challenge was an example of being contacted by a client with a fairly clear requirement. 

Create an app for data storage and inventory status. 
In this case a library that needed to track, store and review the status of their books.

A UI was not requested, only the logical side and data storage, so the majority of the work was done in Ruby.rb and stored in a YAML.yml file acting as the library.


### Requirement translated into USER STORIES
----

As the client
in order to keep track of inventory and show customer what's availible and if not, when.
Display books and authors.

As a visitor
in order to find what I am looking for
I want to display all books.

as a visitor 
in order to know when to give back the book
I want a reciept that tells me when I need to hand it back.

As a librarian, 
I want a system that can automatically update when book is borrowed.


### Dependencies
Rspec for unit testing and pry for debugging.

### Setup


#### instructions


#### Acknowledgements
Previous CA students for inspiration. 
special focus on AugustEnhager & maxarvid though tried not to plagarism.

#### Updates

Some of the functions are not working properly. 
I am unable to borrow a book from the library.
The code also lacks a UI, that could increase the ease for search functions for both client and customers of the library.

I focused mainly on the code instead of the user specs. It was a deliberate decition from my end.
