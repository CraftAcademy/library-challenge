The purpose of this challenge is to create a prototype application to allow a newly built library to keep track of its books.


### **Library Requirements and User Stories**
-------
#### The Library program is working with the following requirements and we have identified the associated user stories.

* **Requirement #1:** 

  "We need an app where both the visitors and the library can see if a list of books is available, it would be nice to see both the title and the author of the book. 

  *User story:*
  ```
  As a visitor
  In order to choose a book to borrow
  I would like to see a list of books currently available in the library
  with information about the title and author
  ```

* **Requirement #2:** 

  "The library needs to store these books in a file where we can easily check if a book is available or not." 

  *User story:*
  ```
  As a librarian
  In order to know what books we are able to lend to visitors
  I would like to be able to be able to see the availability of books in the collection
  ```

* **Requirement #3:** 

  "The library also needs the visitors to check out books after finding the title they want." 

  *User story:*
  ```
  As a librarian
  In order to update the availability of books in the collection
  I would like to be able to allow individuals to check out a book
  ```

* **Requirement #4:** 

  "Depending on the time of the checkout the library needs the books to be returned within a month and obviously, it would be nice for the visitor to know which date to return the book."

  *User stories:*
  ```
  As a librarian
  In order to make the books available to other visitors in a timely manner
  I would like to set a return date 1 month from checkout date
  ```

  ```
  As an visitor
  In order to avoid unwanted fines, and to generally do the right thing
  I would like to know when my book is supposed to be returned
  ```
