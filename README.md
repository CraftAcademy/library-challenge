##Library Challenge
###Week 1 Ruby challenge

Adding a line to the file

Due to personal issues my pairing partner unfortunatelly could not pair up on the main day we had planned to do the challenge. I got inspired and help from Rupert, Noel, Angelica, Zack and Albert. I did not copy any code.

#### User story library visitor

```
As a library visitor 
In order to borrow a book
I want to be able to check out available books, by title and author
```

```
As a library
In order to offer books to a visitor
I would like to have a searchable collection of books
which can be explored by title, author, and availability
```

#### Instructions

I can create an instance of Library but for some reason not of Person, even though the test pass.

I managed to create 3 tests for the Library class and 3 (with one not passing... ) for the Person class.
