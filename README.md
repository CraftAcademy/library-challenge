this project has been a real challenge.
we have used more than 20 hours this weekend and we are
 to mentally tired to continue. anyway, we believe we did 
 a decent progress

###########################################
THE best part of the challenge was to work together 
with several groups, trying to figure it out.
We try first an approach the challenge similarly than
 with the ATM challenge, but after some hours of headache 
 we realize books and digits of money are not the same, 
 for this we think in a different approach, and the morning
  of sunday we finally made some progress.
We create the use stories to guide us and we achieve the 
result desired with them.
